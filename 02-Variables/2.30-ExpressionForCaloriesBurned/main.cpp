/*
The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input is:

49 155 148 60
the output is:

Calories: 736.21 calories

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {

   int age;
   int weight;
   int heartRate;
   int minutes;
   double calories;
   
   cin >> age >> weight >> heartRate >> minutes;
   
   calories = ((age * 0.2757) + (weight * 0.03295) + ((heartRate * 1.0781) - 75.4991)) * minutes / 8.368;
   
   cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
   cout << "Calories: " << calories << " calories" << endl;
   return 0;
